You are tasked with transforming a social media management web application into a professional, modern, premium-quality analytics and management platform. Act as if you are the Manager, Creative Team, and Digital Marketing Team combined - think about what would make this platform incredibly easy to use, visually stunning, and functionally powerful.
CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:

Dashboard vs Task Manager: Currently has duplicate content. Recreate the dashboard as a true analytical dashboard with metrics, charts, and insights (inspired by shadcn/ui and 21st.dev components).
Remove from Task Manager Page:

Remove the three-dots menu from the Actions column entirely
Remove the Priority column


Make Filters Fully Functional:

Add comprehensive filtering system (status, platform, date range, content type, team member)
Make filters work professionally like enterprise management tools
Add search functionality across all relevant pages


Content Planner Page:

Make the calendar fully functional
Enable content scheduling directly from calendar
Add drag-and-drop for rescheduling
Implement filters for calendar view (by platform, status, content type)


Add New Page - Campaign Overview:

Create a campaign analytics page with metrics like reach, engagement, ROI
Include campaign performance charts and graphs
Show campaign timeline and milestones
Display budget tracking and spending analytics



DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

Fully responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop, large screens)
Follow shadcn/ui design patterns and 21st.dev component aesthetics
Modern, clean, premium aesthetic with subtle animations
Professional color palette with proper contrast
Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
Card-based layouts with proper spacing
Use of glassmorphism and subtle shadows where appropriate

FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS:
Think like a professional team managing social media:

What metrics matter most? (engagement rate, reach, conversions, ROI)
What actions are performed frequently? (scheduling, editing, analytics review)
What insights would help decision-making? (trends, best posting times, content performance)
How can we reduce clicks and improve workflow?

PAGES STRUCTURE:

Dashboard (Analytics-focused):

Key metrics cards (followers, engagement, reach, conversions)
Performance charts (line, bar, pie charts)
Recent activity feed
Top performing content
Platform comparison
Quick action buttons


Task Manager (Simplified):

Clean table without priority column or three-dots menu
Inline edit capabilities
Status badges
Direct action buttons (edit, delete)
Advanced filters
Bulk actions


Content Planner:

Fully functional calendar
Drag-and-drop scheduling
Multiple view modes (month, week, day)
Color-coded by platform
Quick preview on hover
Filters sidebar


Campaign Overview (NEW):

Campaign cards with key metrics
Performance graphs
ROI calculator
Budget vs. actual spending
Campaign timeline
Team collaboration section



TECHNICAL STACK:

React with hooks
Tailwind CSS for styling
Lucide React for icons
Recharts for data visualization
Ensure NO use of localStorage/sessionStorage (use React state only)
Make it production-ready and bug-free

IMPORTANT: Make this feel like a premium SaaS product that costs $99/month. Every interaction should feel smooth, every design decision should be intentional, and every feature should serve a real business need. Think Notion, Linear, and Vercel's design quality.
