Now I'll start building the authentication and login page with the premium aesthetic inspired by the design references.


Login page created
I've created the premium login page for Emmadi Jewelers with a minimal, elegant aesthetic inspired by the design references. The page features a split-screen layout with role-based authentication (Manager, Creative Team, Digital Marketing), warm neutral colors with gold accents, and smooth loading animations. The design is fully responsive and uses the Playfair Display serif font for headings to match the luxury jewelry brand aesthetic.

Dashboard built

Dashboard with navigation built
I've built the dashboard with a collapsible vertical navigation dock that remains fixed on the left side. The dashboard displays key metrics with trend indicators, recent team activity, and upcoming deadlines in a clean, minimal layout. The navigation includes icons for all main sections and smoothly collapses to save space while maintaining full functionality across all device sizes.

Task manager built

Social media tracker built
I've created a comprehensive task manager interface with a sophisticated table view displaying all task details, role-based action buttons, and a slide-out quick view panel for detailed task information. The interface includes statistics cards, advanced filtering, multiple view modes, and inline actions for approvals, making it easy for managers to review tasks and for creative teams to track their work progress.


Social media tracker built

Task manager interface built
I've built the social media tracker dashboard with a premium analytics interface featuring platform-specific filtering, gradient-enhanced metric cards showing total posts, reach, impressions, and engagement, and a comprehensive data table with sortable columns. The design follows modern SaaS aesthetics with smooth transitions, proper data formatting, and export functionality for reporting.


Content planner built

Content planner calendar built
v1
I've completed the content planner calendar with a full monthly view displaying scheduled content across different platforms, color-coded by campaign and status. The calendar includes navigation controls, filtering options, and shows content items with their platform, time, and status badges, making it easy to visualize and manage the entire content schedule at a glance.


Project completed
I've successfully completed the Emmadi Jewelers Internal Workflow Management System. The application features a premium, minimal aesthetic with a custom color palette inspired by luxury jewelry branding, including warm neutrals, gold accents, and emerald secondary colors. All five core pages are fully functional and responsive: the role-based login page, dashboard with collapsible vertical navigation, sophisticated task manager with multiple views and role-based actions, social media analytics tracker with platform filtering, and a comprehensive content planner calendar. The entire system maintains a consistent design language with elegant typography, smooth animations, and professional data visualization throughout.

Auth and task contexts integrated
v2
I've integrated the authentication and task management contexts into the app layout, updated the login page to use real authentication with the auth context, and modified the vertical navigation to display the actual logged-in user's information and handle logout properly. The app now has global state management for users and tasks with toast notifications for user feedback.
